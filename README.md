Carton is a modern, cross platform UI library for Rust.
It strives to provide a very easy-to-use and easy-to-read API while still allowing full control over the entire system.
It also aims to be a write once, run anywhere solution.
This means your application should be able to run on any platform, all under a single codebase.

Carton differs from many other UI libraries in its design.
It is modeled to take full advantage of the Rust ecosystem and compiler.
This means it is designed to be functional and concrete throughout the entire system.
It's not just a binding for another library for Rust and it doesn't try to apply object-oriented design into Rust.
It's built from the ground up to be as efficient and easy to use as possible.

## Current Status

Carton is currently in its infancy.
API's are expected to change and break things.
While it does conform to [Rust's version guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-version-field), things still might break version to version.

When Carton gets to a stable point, it will move to version 1.0.
This will mark the end of its "alpha" stage and will mean that it is ready to be used in production software.
